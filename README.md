Welcome to $\color{brown}{\textsf{rwar.fun}}$! This project is a $\color{beige}{\textsf{Browser-based}}$ multiplayer game inspired by the popular game $\color{green}{\textsf{florr.io}}$, with a twist. Navigate through a vibrant and challenging map, collect different petals with unique abilities, and engage in intense battles with ancient dinosaurs, all while trying to survive to become the ultimate champion.

## Features
- **$\color{beige}{\textsf{Multiplayer-Experience:}}$** Engage in real-time battles and team against the Dinosaurs with players from around the world. (PvP Coming Soon!)
- **$\color{beige}{\textsf{Petal-Collection:}}$** Defeating mobs will drop petals which can be collected by your character.
- **$\color{beige}{\textsf{Animal-Avoidance:}}$** Navigate through tough mobs while playing.
- **$\color{beige}{\textsf{Progressive-Gameplay:}}$** Unlock new features and abilities as you level up and progress through the game.

## How to Play
1. **Access the $\color{red}{\textsf{Game}}$:** Simply go to https://rwar.fun in any browser. (Mobile is currently broken)
2. **ðŸŽ®Controls:** Use your cursor to move your character. You can switch this to WASD or arrow keys in the settings menu.
3. **Progression:** Gather resources by running defeating several unique mobs. Upon defeat, mobs will have chances to drop different unique petals. Running over them will put them into your inventory. (A magnet will work too)
4. **Crafting:** Collect five of a petal of the same rarity, to attempt to combine them into one petal of the next rarity. Keep in mind you can destroy 1-4 petals in this process!
5. **Squadding:** Create private squads to send codes to specific people, or find a public squad to play with and defeat dino's!
